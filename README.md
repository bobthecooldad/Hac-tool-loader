# Hac-tool-loader
Loads files as batch

You will need hactool from here: https://github.com/SciresM/hactool/releases
You will need the keys in a file called keys.dat in the folder of hactool. (use the gui tool to set all this up and to get the files)
You need to change the directory of the folders to the place on your computer.
